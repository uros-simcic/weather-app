# Backtest report

Holdout: most recent 12 weeks (temporal split, not random).

Every row below is `unknown-horizon`: Open-Meteo's historical archive returns one value per hour, not the original forecast trajectory, so true lead-time can't be recovered from it. Real per-run lead time (and the 0-24h/1-3d/3-5d/5-10d buckets this cell will eventually split into) only exists once fetch_models.py's live daily logs accumulate — train.py combines both sources going forward.

**Truth-source caveat:** ground truth here is Open-Meteo's archive (ERA5), which is ECMWF's own reanalysis — so ECMWF-family members are measured partly against their own output and will look better than they are. Treat any ECMWF-favouring result as an upper bound, and prefer verification.csv (real Bilje / Nova Gorica station readings) as it accumulates. This is why the shipped choice is a weighted blend rather than ECMWF alone, even where ECMWF alone scores best here.

**The winner's own score is optimistic.** All five candidates are scored on the same holdout the winner is then picked from, so the `ships` column and its MAE come from one number doing two jobs. The lowest of five is low partly on merit and partly on luck, and the margin over the runner-up is the part that is least real — a win by less than a few thousandths should be read as a tie. The comparison between candidates is still fair; it is the winning figure taken as an estimate of live accuracy that is biased low. Note also that every row is one decision made on ~85 days of hourly rows, and consecutive hours are far from independent, so the effective sample behind each choice is nearer 85 than the printed `n`.

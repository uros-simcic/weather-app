# Backtest report

Holdout: most recent 12 weeks (temporal split, not random).

Every row below is `unknown-horizon`: Open-Meteo's historical archive returns one value per hour, not the original forecast trajectory, so true lead-time can't be recovered from it. Real per-run lead time (and the 0-24h/1-3d/3-5d/5-10d buckets this cell will eventually split into) only exists once fetch_models.py's live daily logs accumulate — train.py combines both sources going forward.

**Truth-source caveat:** ground truth here is Open-Meteo's archive (ERA5), which is ECMWF's own reanalysis — so ECMWF-family members are measured partly against their own output and will look better than they are. Treat any ECMWF-favouring result as an upper bound, and prefer verification.csv (real Bilje / Nova Gorica station readings) as it accumulates. This is why the shipped choice is a weighted blend rather than ECMWF alone, even where ECMWF alone scores best here.
